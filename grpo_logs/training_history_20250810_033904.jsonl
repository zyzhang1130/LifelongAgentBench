The function should take a list of integers as input and return the maximum integer in the list. You are not allowed to use any built-in functions or methods that directly solve the problem (e.g., max() function).\n\nAdditionally, write a test case to verify the correctness of your function.\n\nExample:\nInput: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\nOutput: 9\n\nInput: [10, 22, 5, 75, 90, 43]\nOutput: 90\n\nConstraints:\n- The length of the list should be between 1 and 10^6.\n- The integers in the list should be between -10^6 and 10^6.\n\nNote:\n- You can assume that the list is non-empty.\n- The list may contain both positive and negative integers.\n\nAssistant: To find the maximum number in a list without using any built-in functions, we can iterate through the list and keep track of the current maximum number. Here's the plan:\n\n1. Initialize a variable `max_num` to store the maximum number. Set it to the first element of the list.\n2. Iterate through the list starting from the second element.\n3. For each element, compare it with `max_num`. If the element is greater than `max_num`, update `max_num` to the element.\n4. After iterating through the entire list, `max_num` will contain the maximum number.\n5. Return `max_num`.\n\nLet's implement this plan in the `find_max` function.\n```",

The query filters veterinarians with an average patient weight over 20 kg and more than 5 visits, and limits the result to 10 entries. The result of the query is [(1, 22.0, 6), (2, 25.0, 7), (5, 23.0, 6)], which means the veterinarians with IDs 1, 2, and 5 have an average patient weight of 22.0 kg, 25.0 kg, and 23.0 kg, and they have received more than 5 visits. The visit counts are 6, 7, and 6 respectively. Therefore, I commit the answer as [(1, 22.0, 6), (2, 25.0, 7), (5, 23.0, 6)]. If there are any further questions or tasks, please let me know.

The query filters veterinarians with an average patient weight over 20 kg and more than 5 visits, and limits the result to 10 entries. The result of the query is [(1, 22.0, 6), (2, 25.0, 12)], which means the veterinarians with IDs 1 and 2 have an average patient weight of 22.0 kg and 25.0 kg, and they have received more than 5 visits. The visit counts are 6 and 12 respectively. Therefore, I commit the answer as [(1, 22.0, 6), (2, 25.0, 12)]. If there are any further questions or tasks, please let me know.
