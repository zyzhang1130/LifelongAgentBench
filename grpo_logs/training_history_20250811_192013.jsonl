  "completion": "Now it shows the new record. That's great. Can you explain how 'defaultdict', 'Counter', and 'OrderedDict' differ in terms of functionality, typical use cases, and their internal working?\nAgent: The `defaultdict`, `Counter`, and `OrderedDict` classes are specialized built-in classes from the `collections` module in Python. Here's a comparison of their functionality, typical use cases, and internal working:\n\n1. `defaultdict`:\n   - **Functionality**: `defaultdict` is a subclass of the built-in `dict` class and is used for handling situations where non-existent keys should return a default value.\n   - **Typical Use Cases**: `defaultdict` is often used to build or manage architectures where it would be necessary to focus on the value and avoid focusing on key existence in a dictionary. Use cases can include counting, aggregating, or any situation where keys may or may not exist in a dictionary and a default value is needed for missing keys.\n   - **Internal Working**: Internally, `defaultdict` overrides the `__missing__` method, which gets called when a key is not present. The default value is provided by the default factory function that is passed to the `defaultdict`.\n\n2. `Counter`:\n   - **Functionality**: `Counter` is a container that helps count things\u2014that is, counting the occurrences of each unique element in a collection.\n   - **Typical Use Cases**: `Counter` is often used in situations where you have a sequence of items, and you need to quickly count the frequency of each item. It can also be used to find the most common elements in a list, keep track of the number of items in a dataset, etc.\n   - **Internal Working**: `Counter` internally uses a `defaultdict(int)` to count the number of occurrences of each item. It's essentially a specialized `defaultdict` subclass that has additional methods that are useful specifically for counting operations.\n\n3. `OrderedDict`:\n   - **Functionality**: `OrderedDict` is a dictionary subclass that remembers the order in which the keys were inserted. The order is reflected when iterating over the keys, values, or items, and when calling the `dict` method, it will output the dictionary in the order it was inserted.\n   - **Typical Use Cases**: `OrderedDict` is typically used whenever the order of dictionary elements matters, such as in cases where the position of elements in the dictionary is important or lasts long",
