This is because the original data type of the 'amount' column is INT, but the result of the SUM function is a decimal value. In order to match the expected output format, I have used the Decimal class to represent the decimal values. However, if the original data type of the 'amount' column is actually DECIMAL, then the final answer should use the actual decimal values instead of strings.
