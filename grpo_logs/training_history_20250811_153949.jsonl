  "completion": "Now it shows the new record. That's great. Let's move on to explaining the differences between the Python defaultdict, Counter, and OrderedDict data types. \n\ndefaultdict: This data type is particularly useful when we want to create a dictionary with a pre-defined default value. As you mentioned, the default value is defined as a function that provides the initial value for the key that is not yet in the dictionary.\n\nCounter: This data type is a specialized dictionary used for counting hashable objects. It is initialized from an iterable or a dictionary (or a mapping with the _keys_ and a list, tuple, or set with the _values_). Counters are useful for counting occurrences of elements in a list, string, etc.\n\nOrderedDict: This data type maintains the order in which the keys were first inserted. This is useful in cases where the order of elements matters.\n\n\nAgent: `defaultdict`, `Counter`, and `OrderedDict` are all part of the `collections` module in Python, each with their unique purposes:\n\n- `defaultdict`: This subclass of `dict` allows you to specify a default value factory (a function that provides a default value for the dictionary where the key does not exist yet). This is particularly handy when you want to increment the value for a key that may not be present in the dictionary. Here is a simplified example:\n  ```python\n  from collections import defaultdict\n  d = defaultdict(int)  # Initializes all values to 0 using the int() function\n  d['a'] += 1  # d['a'] is now 1\n  d['b'] += 1  # d['b'] is also 1, as it was 0 and then incremented\n  ```\n\n- `Counter`: This class is a specialized dictionary that holds the count of elements from an iterable. The elements can be any hashable objects. For example:\n  ```python\n  from collections import Counter\n  c = Counter([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3])  # Counter({3: 3, 2: 2, 1: 1})\n  ```\n\n- `OrderedDict`: This class remembers the order elements were first inserted. It is useful when you need to maintain the order of elements. Here is an example:\n  ```python\n  from collections import OrderedDict\n  d = OrderedDict()\n  d['a'] = 1\n  d['b'] = 2\n  #",
