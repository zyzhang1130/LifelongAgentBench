Let's move on to explaining the differences between the Python defaultdict, Counter, and OrderedDict data types.\n\nAgent: The differences between the Python `defaultdict`, `Counter`, and `OrderedDict` data types can be explained as follows:\n\n- `defaultdict`:\n  - Purpose: It is a subclass of `dict` and provides a default value for keys that are not yet in the dictionary when accessed.\n  - Use Case: Useful when you want to initialize dictionary values to a certain default value (e.g., `0`, `[]`, `\"\"`, etc.).\n  - Example:\n    ```python\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    d = defaultdict(int)  # Setting int() as the default value factory\n    d['a'] += 1  # 'a' is added to the dictionary with a default value of 0, then incremented by 1\n    d['b'] += 1  # 'b' is added to the dictionary with a default value of 0, then incremented by 1\n    print(d)  # Output: defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {'a': 1, 'b': 1})\n    ```\n- `Counter`:\n  - Purpose: It is a subclass of `dict` and is specifically designed to count hashable objects.\n  - Use Case: Ideal for counting the occurrences of elements in a list, string, etc.\n  - Example:\n    ```python\n    from collections import Counter\n    c = Counter(['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'banana'])\n    print(c)  # Output: Counter({'banana': 3, 'apple': 2, 'orange': 1})\n    ```\n- `OrderedDict`:\n  - Purpose: It is a dictionary subclass that remembers the order in which keys were first inserted.\n  - Use Case: Useful when you need to maintain the order in which items were inserted and do not want the dictionary to rearrange the keys.\n  - Example:\n    ```python\n    from collections import OrderedDict\n    od = OrderedDict()\n    od['apple'] = 1\n    od['banana'] = 2\n    od['orange'] = 3\n    print(od)  # Output: OrderedDict([('apple', 1), ('banana', 2), ('orange', 3)])\n    ```\n\nDoes this explanation adequately describe the differences between `defaultdict`, `Counter`, and `",

Your SQL should be in one line.\nI will use \"Action: Operation\" literally to match your SQL.\nEvery time you can only execute one SQL statement. I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf the SQL is not executed successfully, the response will be the error message.\nOtherwise, the response will be the raw MySQL response.\nFor SELECT queries, the response will be the result of the query, such as [(1, 'John Doe', 'HR'), (2, 'Jane Smith', 'IT'), ...], where each tuple represents a row and the elements are the values of the columns in the row.\nFor SQL such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, the response will be an empty list [] indicating that the SQL was executed successfully.\n\nIf you have obtain the answer by interacting with the database, and you MUST commit your final answer using the format like this:\nAction: Answer\nFinal Answer: [(1, 'John Doe', 'HR'), (2, 'Jane Smith', 'IT'), ...]\nDO NOT write this pattern unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf the question is about querying the database, then after done operation, your answer field should be the result of the query.\nWe note that the column names will not be displayed in the result, and you need to ensure both the orders of the columns and rows are correct.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nOnce you commit your answer or the number of rounds reaches 3, the task will be finished and the system will judge whether you pass the task or not.\n\nNow, I will give you the question that you need to solve.\n\nAgent: OK.\n\nUser: Which customers have given a rating of 4 or higher?
