  "completion": "Now it shows the new record. That's great. Can you explain how 'defaultdict', 'Counter', and 'OrderedDict' differ in terms of functionality, typical use cases, and their internal working?\nAgent: The `defaultdict`, `Counter`, and `OrderedDict` classes are specialized built-in classes from the `collections` module in Python. Here's how they differ in terms of functionality, typical use cases, and internal workings:\n\n### 1. `defaultdict`\n- **Functionality**: A dictionary with a default factory which is used to provide a default value for a key that does not exist.\n- **Typical Use Cases**: \n  - Use cases where you need to initialize a dictionary with default values to avoid `KeyError` exceptions.\n  - It can be used to count or aggregate a collection of items with a default initial value.\n- **Internal Working**: \n  - It uses a lambda or another function as its default factory to create new values if a key is not found.\n  - The factory function is called when an attempt is made to access a non-existent key.\n  \n  ```python\n  from collections import defaultdict\n\n  # Using int as the factory function\n  d = defaultdict(int)\n  print(d['a'])  # Output: 0 (default value of int)\n\n  d['a'] += 1\n  d['b'] += 1\n  print(d.items())  # Output: defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {'a': 1, 'b': 1})\n  ```\n\n### 2. `Counter`\n- **Functionality**: A specialized dictionary subclass for counting hashable objects. It is an unordered collection where elements are stored as dictionary keys and their counts are stored as dictionary values.\n- **Typical Use Cases**: \n  - Use cases where you need to count occurrences of elements in a collection (list, string, etc.).\n  - It\u2019s useful for frequency distribution and commonly used in natural language processing.\n- **Internal Working**:\n  - `Counter` maintains a dictionary where the keys are the elements of the input collection and the values are the counts of those elements.\n  - The most common elements have a higher count than less frequent elements.\n  \n  ```python\n  from collections import Counter\n\n  c = Counter(['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'a'])\n  print(c)  # Output: Counter({'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c",
