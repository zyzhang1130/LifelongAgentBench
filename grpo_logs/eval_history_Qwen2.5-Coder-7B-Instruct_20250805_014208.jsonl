Guests who have submitted more than 5 feedback entries with an average rating below 2.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Complaints with a Rating Below 3\nFirst, we need to find all complaint records with a rating below 3.\n\n**SQL Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT feedback_id \nFROM hotel_feedback_records \nWHERE feedback_type = 'complaint' AND rating < 3;\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify Guests with More Than 5 Feedback Entries with an Average Rating Below 2\nNext, we need to identify guests who have submitted more than 5 feedback entries with an average rating below 2. We will use a subquery to achieve this.\n\n**Subquery:**\n```sql\nSELECT guest_id \nFROM hotel_feedback_records \nGROUP BY guest_id \nHAVING COUNT(*) > 5 AND AVG(rating) < 2;\n```\n\n### Step 3: Combine Both Conditions\nFinally, we combine both conditions to get the feedback IDs that meet either of the criteria.\n\n**Combined Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT feedback_id \nFROM hotel_feedback_records \nWHERE feedback_type = 'complaint' AND rating < 3 \n   OR guest_id IN (\n       SELECT guest_id \n       FROM hotel_feedback_records \n       GROUP BY guest_id \n       HAVING COUNT(*) > 5 AND AVG(rating) < 2\n   );\n```\n\n### Step 4: Delete the Identified Records\nNow that we have the feedback IDs that meet the criteria, we can delete these records from the `hotel_feedback_records` table.\n\n**Delete Query:**\n```sql\nDELETE FROM hotel_feedback_records \nWHERE feedback_id IN (\n    SELECT feedback_id \n    FROM hotel_feedback_records \n    WHERE feedback_type = 'complaint' AND rating < 3 \n       OR guest_id IN (\n           SELECT guest_id \n           FROM hotel_feedback_records \n           GROUP BY guest_id \n           HAVING COUNT(*) > 5 AND AVG(rating) < 2\n       )\n);\n```\n\n### Action: Operation\n```sql\nDELETE FROM hotel_feedback_records \nWHERE feedback_id IN (\n    SELECT feedback_id \n    FROM hotel_feedback_records \n    WHERE feedback_type = 'complaint' AND rating < 3 \n       OR guest_id IN (\n           SELECT guest_id \n           FROM hotel_feedback_records \n           GROUP BY guest_id",

Complaints with a rating below 3.\n2. Guests who have submitted more than 5 feedback entries with an average rating below 2.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Complaints with a Rating Below 3\nFirst, we need to find all complaint records with a rating below 3.\n\n**SQL Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT feedback_id \nFROM hotel_feedback_records \nWHERE feedback_type = 'complaint' AND rating < 3;\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify Guests with More Than 5 Feedback Entries with an Average Rating Below 2\nNext, we need to identify guests who have submitted more than 5 feedback entries with an average rating below 2. We will use a subquery to achieve this.\n\n**Subquery:**\n```sql\nSELECT guest_id \nFROM hotel_feedback_records \nGROUP BY guest_id \nHAVING COUNT(*) > 5 AND AVG(rating) < 2;\n```\n\n### Step 3: Combine Both Conditions\nFinally, we combine both conditions to get the feedback IDs that meet either of the criteria.\n\n**Combined Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT feedback_id \nFROM hotel_feedback_records \nWHERE feedback_type = 'complaint' AND rating < 3 \n   OR guest_id IN (\n       SELECT guest_id \n       FROM hotel_feedback_records \n       GROUP BY guest_id \n       HAVING COUNT(*) > 5 AND AVG(rating) < 2\n   );\n```\n\n### Step 4: Delete the Identified Records\nNow that we have the feedback IDs that meet the criteria, we can delete these records from the `hotel_feedback_records` table.\n\n**Delete Query:**\n```sql\nDELETE FROM hotel_feedback_records \nWHERE feedback_id IN (\n    SELECT feedback_id \n    FROM hotel_feedback_records \n    WHERE feedback_type = 'complaint' AND rating < 3 \n       OR guest_id IN (\n           SELECT guest_id \n           FROM hotel_feedback_records \n           GROUP BY guest_id \n           HAVING COUNT(*) > 5 AND AVG(rating) < 2\n       )\n);\n```\n\n### Action: Operation\n```sql\nDELETE FROM hotel_feedback_records \nWHERE feedback_id IN (\n    SELECT feedback_id \n    FROM hotel_feedback_records \n    WHERE feedback_type = 'complaint' AND rating < 3 \n       OR guest_id IN (\n           SELECT guest_id \n           FROM hotel_feedback_records \n           GROUP BY guest_id\n\nUser: [(4,), (7,), (8,), (9,), (13,), (18,), (19,), (22,), (26,)]",

Packages that are marked as 'lost' with a last update date before January 1, 2023.\n2. Packages that have an ID belonging to packages weighing less than 5 kilograms.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the packages that meet the conditions**:\n   - For 'lost' packages with a last update before January 1, 2023.\n   - For packages weighing less than 5 kilograms.\n\n2. **Limit the deletion to up to 100 packages**:\n   - We need to ensure that we do not delete more than 100 packages even if there are many that meet the criteria.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the packages that meet the conditions\n\nFirst, let's identify the packages that meet the conditions:\n\n```sql\nSELECT package_id \nFROM package_tracking \nWHERE status = 'lost' AND last_updated < '2023-01-01'\nUNION ALL\nSELECT package_id \nFROM package_tracking \nWHERE weight_kg < 5;\n```\n\nThis query will give us a list of `package_id`s that meet either of the conditions.\n\n#### Step 2: Limit the deletion to up to 100 packages\n\nSince we need to limit the deletion to up to 100 packages, we will use the `LIMIT` clause:\n\n```sql\nDELETE FROM package_tracking \nWHERE package_id IN (\n    SELECT package_id \n    FROM package_tracking \n    WHERE status = 'lost' AND last_updated < '2023-01-01'\n    UNION ALL\n    SELECT package_id \n    FROM package_tracking \n    WHERE weight_kg < 5\n) \nLIMIT 100;\n```\n\n### Explanation of the SQL Query\n\n1. **Subquery**: The subquery identifies the `package_id`s that meet either of the conditions.\n   ```sql\n   SELECT package_id \n   FROM package_tracking \n   WHERE status = 'lost' AND last_updated < '2023-01-01'\n   UNION ALL\n   SELECT package_id \n   FROM package_tracking \n   WHERE weight_kg < 5;\n   ```\n\n2. **Main Query**: The main query deletes up to 100 packages from the `package_tracking` table where the `",
